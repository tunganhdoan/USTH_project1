# GUIDELINE FOR USTH PROJECT 1:

## Project name: Projectile Motion
## Project description:
One of the most classic and well-known problems in physics is **projectile motion**.

>**Projectile motion** is a form of motion experienced by an object that is projected near the Earthâ€™s surface and moves along a curved path. This type of motion can also be known as a **ballistic trajectory**.   


### Realistic Projectile motion

To describe **realistic** projectile motion, we need to consider the effects of **air resistance**, or **drag**, which can be significant and interesting.


## Equations of motion:
see ppt slideshow

### Input parameters:
1. Initial velocity
2. Initial angle
3. mass
4. diameter
5. Numerical method options: [Euler, Improved Euler, Runge-Kutta]
### Output results:
1. Horizontal range, flight time, highest point
2. A static plot showing 2D projectile's trajectory
3. An animating plot showing 2D projectile's trajectory in real-time
## Project requirements:
1. Physics-based algorithm
2. GUI design (Tkinter, turtle, pygame, etc...)
3. Simple animating demonstration
